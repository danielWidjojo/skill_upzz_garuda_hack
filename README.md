English is regarded as a universal language. Not only is English the official language in 70 countries, but it is, at the very least, understood amongst scholars, as well as those in government, media and academia. In fact, studies have shown that English is spoken, at a comprehensible level, by one person in every four. This means that it is spoken by roughly 1.75 billion people worldwide! In addition, English-speaking countries make up a staggering 40% of the worldâ€™s total GNP.  

It is clear that a good command of the English language is necessary to further your influential reach, enter prestigious universities or educational bodies, build connections, and help realise economic prosperity. In particular, it is vital to develop the skill of English writing due to the prevalence of the internet and online social media. This has never been more true after the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to the increase in popularity of remote work and online networking. However, it may be a struggle for native Indonesian speakers to adapt to this remote-oriented lifestyle, and properly integrate with the rest of the world.
